# NAME

Dancer::Template::Mustache - Wrapper for the Mustache template system

# VERSION

version 0.1.1

# SYNOPSIS

     # in config.yml
    template: mustache

    # in the app
    get '/style/:style' => sub {
        template 'style' => {
            style => param('style')
        };
    };

    # in views/style.mustache
    That's a nice, manly {{style}} mustache you have there!

# DESCRIPTION

This module is a [Dancer](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Dancer) wrapper for [Template::Mustache](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Template::Mustache). 

For now, the extension of the mustache templates must be `.mustache`.

Partials are supported, as are layouts. For layouts, the content of the inner
template is sent via the usual _content_ template variable. So a typical 
mustached layout would look like:

    <body>
    {{ content }}
    </body>
